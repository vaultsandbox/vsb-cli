### Pull Requests

We love pull requests. Here's a quick guide:

1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix: `git checkout -b feat/my-awesome-feature` or `git checkout -b fix/that-annoying-bug`.
3.  Make your changes, adhering to the coding style.
4.  Add or update tests for your changes.
5.  Ensure all tests pass (`go test ./...`).
6.  Ensure your code is formatted and vetted (`gofmt -s -w .` and `go vet ./...`).
7.  Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message.
8.  Push your branch to your fork.
9.  Open a pull request to the `main` branch of the upstream repository.

## Development Setup

This project is a CLI tool built with Go.

1.  Ensure you have Go 1.24+ installed.
2.  Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
3.  Download dependencies: `go mod download`
4.  Build the CLI: `go build -o vsb ./cmd/vsb`
5.  Configuration: Set `VSB_API_KEY` environment variable or create a config file at `~/.config/vsb/config.yaml`.

## Running Tests

- **Run all tests**:
  ```bash
  go test ./...
  ```
- **Run tests with verbose output**:
  ```bash
  go test -v ./...
  ```
- **Generate a coverage report**:
  ```bash
  go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
  go tool cover -html=coverage.out
  ```

## Coding Style

- **Formatting**: We use `gofmt` for automated code formatting. Please run `gofmt -s -w .` before committing your changes.
- **Linting**: We use `go vet` for identifying suspicious constructs. Please run `go vet ./...` to check your code. Consider also using [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/) for comprehensive linting.
- **Comments**: For new features or complex logic, please add GoDoc-style comments to explain the _why_ behind your code. Exported functions and types should have documentation comments.

Thank you for your contribution!
